# Proxmox Basics

qm allows you to talk to the virtual machines on the system. We can call

- `qm start 101` to start the vm at node 101.
- `qm clone 101 201` will clone the image from 101 in 201
 - `qmrestore` allows you to take a dump and restore the image.

`pct` allows us to talk with the containers
`pct list` for containers.

`pct enter 101` - ssh into the container.
