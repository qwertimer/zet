# TIL -r can be added after cp and rm

When i have gone to run a command on a folder and forgotten to add `-r` i have always gone back to the previous
command and added the `-r` in the middle of the command. However i realised today i can add `-r` after the directories
and it will still work. This saves me so much time and i should have realised this years ago.
