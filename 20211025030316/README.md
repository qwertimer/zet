# Developing a userguide to remember the programs i installed and configured in a certain way

I have found recently that i am learning so many things in linux and the command line that i forget certain programs some of these are incredibly cool.
I have decided that on top of my slowly evolving idea for a blog site i am also going to jot down programs that i have found really useful.

This guide will include links to ansible playbooks that i have developed along with guides on installation. Ultimately i will fork Chris Titus Tech arch installer and modify it with all the programs i wish to have on my system.
