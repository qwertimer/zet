# Line number wand !:<linenumber> magics

If you would like to send a set of lines to a command for example sending from line 4 to 12 to a bash command. 
We can use `!:13<enter>` followed by `bash` or what ever command we wish to send the lines to that command.
This is useful if i want to create a gist from a function.
