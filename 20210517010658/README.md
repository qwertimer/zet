# Getting started with Zets

I needed a way to store all my random tidbits of research and information in a searchable simple setup that can be used cross platform and cross system. The current setup allows me to create zets on sny machine and it automatically pushes to github. If i am on any machine i can pull the git repo and add any new zets when i want.
Following RWXRob on his beginner boost and his github repo - https://github.com/rwxrob/dot, I was able to add robs zet program to my path, the other dependencies the setup has is git, and robs program isosec. With this setup i can keep all my notes in one place.
