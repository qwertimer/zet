# New programs to play with using fzf

Recently i have been looking at the use case of fzf. Whilst it is an excellent tool for changing my reverse search to be more interactive i have found a couple of amazing tools written around fzf and i have added some of these to my workflow. The main one i found and integrated was `fzfgit`

`fzfgit`

This program is not complete however it has some very useful features and maybe one day i might extend it to add the other features it needs.
The program uses fzf and git diff to interactively add and commit git repos. The system is intuitive and reduces that one step in having to check diffs before adding and commiting.

`fzmv`

A simple fuzzy finder move tool to help you choose the files you wish to move to a new directory. This is helpful to reduce the time it takes to move a bunch of files and<Plug>PeepOpenrovides a little interactiveness.

`fv`

A simple terminal file manager for the current directory. Super light simple and provides folder contents and a file previewer.

`sshget`

A command line rsync manager using fzf. This tool is extremely useful when working with my Jetson boards.
