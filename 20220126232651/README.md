# Creating a better homepage with github

After reading rwxrobs zet on github design and looking at TechnoTims new design for his github front page i decided that i would work through creating a new home page for my github. What the page needs is to be simple and readable with links to my main resources available at the touch of a button. So following robs post i have decided to set up a couple of specific repositories for my github.

* dotfiles - My currently maintained dotfiles.
* zet - My zettlekasten repo
* learning-labs - My place for all my dabblings with code.
* Website - Github hosted blog.

These repositories will be pinned and accessible in the about me section.
