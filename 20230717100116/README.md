# Semaphores in programming

The semaphore in programming is used as a method to avoid critical
sections of code having a race condition. Semaphores can be seen as a
kind of synchronisation primitive.

The semaphore keeps track of how many resources are free and not which
resources are free.

We can also think of semaphores as flags marking something as available
for use when the flag is set to true.
