# Nested tmux sessions can be accessed by pressing the prefix key again

In the tao-of-tmux a note on nested tmux sessions is given. For example
if you are in a tmux session and ssh into another computer. If that
machine has tmux running aswell to send tmux commands to it send the
prefix key again. i.e. If i want to send a key press to the ssh session
i would do `Ctrl -b b`.
