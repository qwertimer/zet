# Got popos installed on my surface pro

I found a community project that configured linux for surface touch
devices. This is great i was able to get my old unused surface pro back
to a useful state with this configuration. The git repo i followed is https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Installation-and-Setup
