# Blue eyes are strange

Unrelated to computing but today i read about the rarity of Blue pigment in the world and how almost all blue comes from microstructures in the material reflecting back the blue light. This brought me to the question how are blue eyes made. What is striking with this is that blue eyes are caused by there being no pigment in the stroma and so the blue is reflected just like other species. What is interesting though is that blue eyes are unique in that your eye colour depends on the amount of light in the environment and can change throughout the day. Green or hazel eyes are caused by having light brown pigment in your eyes and can often vary throughout the iris. This is why hazel and green eyed people have such variation in their eye design.
