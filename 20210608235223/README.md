# Globbing in terminal

One of the great things about globbing is that you can create a set of files using
`file{01...10}.{md,txt}` will create 20 files with md and txt for 10 individual files. This is very useful when running tests or other such quick scripts.

`**/*` will find all files in the directory.
`find` is a better resource with regular expressions.
