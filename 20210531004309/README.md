# TMUX key bindings for fast movement

TMUX has many great keybindings. The simplest ones to keep in mind to begin with are `ctrl-b` starts command mode. Then `w` shows all open panes, `?` will show available commands, `c` starts a new tab. `<0-9>` moves to that window, `%` splits the pane horizontally. `,` Will allow the change of tab names.

There are many more commands available but this is a quick primer for use later.
