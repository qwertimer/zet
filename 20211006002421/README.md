# Using a keybinding program across multiple systems

Many window managers come prepackaged with a different keybinding
manager. I found a very useful and simple keybinding manager known as
sxhkd which is configured with very a very simple protocol. I am aiming
to configure this to become my default keybinding program across all my
systems overwriting the inbuilt systems in Ubuntu and Arch window
managers. Once configured hopefully i will be able to use it across all
of my systems
