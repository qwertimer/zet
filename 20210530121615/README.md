# Building up a log and todo zet

Understanding robs code to allow multiple folders for zets is difficult. I have been working to get this completed. My goal is to use the zets as a way to keep a todo list up to date as well as a private repository for all my logs of each days work. This will allow me to get into the habit of writing up what i did each day ans building a todo list. This is then linked to a github repo that i can create issues and manage using the github kanban board or cli gh tool. With these tools i can create a usable pipeline to complete all my goals and tasks.
