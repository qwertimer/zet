# Fun findings in vim

Below are just some tidbit vim findings that may or may not help with my
vim learning.

## Keeping the scroll in the middle of the screen

We can set the sidescrolloff and scrolloff to 999 to keep the cursor in
the middle ofthe screen.

## File completion and command completion
If you want to have command completion or folder completion in vim you
can use while in insert mode
`ctrl-x ctrl-f` to complete files
`ctrl-x ctrl-p` to give selection of completion

This will give you a search bar which would link to different variables
that you have already defined.
