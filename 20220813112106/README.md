# The power of Typer

I have been using typer for many things recently and am amazed with it's
capabilities and what i am able to do with it. Whilst on the face typer
just wraps click commands and makes it pretty, i have found that i can
use typer to test functions with a simple wrapping of the app decorator.
This allows me to test functionality on the fly of a written function
without having to copy into a repl or use jupyter.

Further to this i have found that typer becomes an excellent tool for
creating simple usable system checking tools. This is useful when i have
a suite of tests that are functional and not easily automated in a real
world system i am able to quickly create a testing environment to for
example check the operation of a camera or a sensor.

There is so much that i can do with typer that i need to delve into
further.
