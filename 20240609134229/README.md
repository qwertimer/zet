# improve git workflow with delta and fzf-git

i just found https://github.com/junegunn/fzf-git.sh which has an awesome
setup for looking at diffs and workflows in git. You can use `Crtl-G`
`Ctrl-H` to search using fzf for commits. The tool has File search,
branch search, tags, remotes, hashes, stashes, reflogs, worktrees.

To further improve flow you can add `delta` https://github.com/dandavison/delta which is a git pager tool which utilises `bat` syntax highlighting
