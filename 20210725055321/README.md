# We can operate on search matches using gn in vim

If we search for a word in a file we can work on the search with `gn` we can then use the `.` command to repeat the last edit on each match. This could be useful to add a word as part of the search. For example if we search for `files` and want to change certain matches we can use `gn` to add `local` to the name.
