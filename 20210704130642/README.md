# Learning GO [part 3]

#### Go programming basics 
$GOPATH is the environment variable that stores where the Go programs are
stored. $GOROOT is where GO is installed.


Packages are stored in distinct folders on GOPATH. Many directories but only one
main function in one main file. Always call absolute path when importing.

NOTE: GOPATH is being deprecated look into Go Modules.



Additional Notes - Somewhat unrelated.

#### Web Deployment 
WebApps are bound to a port ie 8888.
We can make the webAPP accessible to the network with 0.0.0.0:8888.
