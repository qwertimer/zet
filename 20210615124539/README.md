# TMUX has a plugin manager

Similar to vim, tmux has a plugin manager. What is great about this is that i
can utilise two powerful plugins tmux-resurrect and tmux-continuum. Resurrect
allows me to reload the same configuration for the next time you restart tmux.
This is handy when working on a certain workflow and needing to restart the
computer or shutdown for the night. Continuum continually saves the current
session, which is useful when linked with tmux-resurrect. There a some other
small plugins that may or may not be useful to people. One i like and might
integrate into my tmux setup is tmux-weather. This puts the weather in the
status line of tmux. tmux-tpm the plugin manager also has a small two liner to
automatically install tpm and added plugins to a new machine.
