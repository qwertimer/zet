# There is a tiling window manager for mac

Just found a twitch streamer was using a tiling window manager on the mac.

It looks pretty good for what it is. If you wanted to have the tiling WM style
on your mac it is available. I do wonder how much customisability is available
in this tool. If i get a mac in the future i may look into using this...
