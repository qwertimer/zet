# Using chroot to run my arcolinux drive

I wanted to build an alci iso from arcolinux but it required me to have
my arch system which is currently not working. Instead of setting up a
live cd and running with that or working with a vm i thought i could run
chroot on the /root directory of this other drive and am able to open up
and look at files. I plan on looking to see if i can build the iso from
ubuntu inside the chrooted drive.
