# Learning golang by building a website

I have been looking at languages to learn and rob recommended learning GO. One
of tthe first videos i looked at

Discussed setting up a website as a simple go project. I am thinking of
integrating what i have been doing here with the zets and my interest in
building a blogging site. The first plan is to just locally host it so i can
view the site from my computer. The front end and queries will probably be all
done in go whilst the backend will have markdown files stored in a structure
and converted to html etc using pandoc. What i plan on doing is integrating
this backend into my code development. At some stage i will look at using a
style sheet and possibly begin to incorporate some of the functionality of the
larger web devs such as jekkyl and github actions to run the server. I will
need to learn more but this will be a way to test my go skills as well as my
knowledge of web dev and learn a new skillset.
