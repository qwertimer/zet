# Idea for building a local search based utility for zets

Zets are an excellent source for storing infomation. However there are a couple of issues that are faced when you don't want to integrate with github. If you need to search for a topic from the command line you will need to parse the contents of the directories to find the information. A program to allow this from the command line will be useful. One thing might be to utilise the gh like tool where you can select from a topic search or text search.

One other program idea i wish to build is to reopen a previous zet but keep the commit message when re pushing it. The zet needs to be opened by either its heading or maybe pull last.
