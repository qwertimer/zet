# Using lynx to its full potential.

I have mentioned in the past about using `Ctrl-n` and `Ctrl-p` to go
down and up respectively in lynx. We close lynx using `q`. There are
many other things lynx can do much like using a normal browser, we can
add sites to a bookmark file using `A` and when we open lynx again we
can view these with `V`. If we want to open a specific site we can use
`g` to go to the site. We can `spacebar` to go to the next screen and
`B` to go back. The `left` arrow goes to the previously viewed link the
`right` arrow goes to the selected link. The `Up` and `Down` arrows go
to the links in either direction. The `=` sign will show the current
website.
