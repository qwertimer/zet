# jtbl to print JSON data as a table on the terminal

kellyjonbrazil has an excellent blog discussing minimalist UNIX programs
and always outputting data into a useful format. One of his big requests
is to make every tool have a JSON output by using a `-j` flag or
similar. `jtbl` developed by him takes any JSON data and plots it as a
table on the terminal. This is useful if you need to view some JSON file
in a more readable format. The program reads from `stdin` and is written
in python. I have taken the `stdin` reader and added it to my snippets
library.

The jtbl tool can be installed by pip and the repository is seen here:
