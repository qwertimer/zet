# Learning about rauc files

* https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/rauc/latest/rauc.pdf

Rauc should be installed on SSD or other such devices rather than raw
NAND.

Rauc can update just the file system content and leave the rootfs
untouched.
Rauc can work with GRUB, Barebox, U-boot etc it is an application layer
but provides an interface to these bootloaders.
