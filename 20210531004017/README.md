# Working with Lynx

Lynx is such a powerful web browser built into the CLI. It makes it super fast and simple to search for a question whilst in the terminal. One of the great things i found today is that after searching for a question you can use the comma key to open the current page in firefox. This allows the extension from written text to view the graphics in firefox. This simple workflow optimisation is incredibly useful.
