# Building Jetson clusters

There are a lot of tools out there to build small scale clusters such as a rpi cluster or a jetson cluster. The company seeed studio has a cluster board that would be excellent for dev testing and kubernetes learning. This blog post details setting up a jetson cluster with kubernetes. It also looks at running tensorflow on the cluster. This design could be utilised to test ML algorithms on the edge with compute nodes. https://medium.com/jit-team/building-a-gpu-enabled-kubernets-cluster-for-machine-learning-with-nvidia-jetson-nano-7b67de74172a. Further research into a board cluster is needed as the only available cluster that looks good is the jetson mate from seeed studio. This however has no m.2 slot for fast drive access. Jeff Geerling also has some articles and youtube videos on clusters and ansible for fast setup. These should be looked into...
