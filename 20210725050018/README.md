# Useful commands to memorize and use vim [part 1]

I have been using vim for a while now and i am feeling i need to improve my vim commands to reduce overhead of keystrokes and wasted time. I am not too worried about time but i can be more efficient at writing code and notes then i dont have to stuff around with deleting letter by letter with `x` or `j`,`k` to move up and down.

The commands to first learn are:

- `<number>G` to move to that location in the file. This is useful rather than using`j` and `k` to move.
- `CTRL-O` takes you to older positions in the file. Useful for when
  using searches.
- `:w <filename>` can be used with a selection to copy the contents to
  a location.
- `:r <filename>` will read the file in at the current line.
