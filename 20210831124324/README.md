# Use `python -i <program.py>` to drop into REPL after execution

It is simple to view the variable values at time of program crashing
with the -i value. This drops the user into the REPL after the program
exits. It will allow you to inspect the variables at the time of the
crash. Useful tool for debugging without using pdb.
