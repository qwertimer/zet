# Configuring sxhkd for gnome and bsp is fun

I was trying to get a more unified gnome and bsp experience with my
keybindings and started delving into the simple keybinding tool sxhkd. I
was struggling to get gnome configured correctly then i found that i
could use the xdotool and pretty much do what ever i needed to. At the
moment i have two configurations with many similarities between bspwm
and gnome. Ultimately i plan on having a launcher script that checks wm
and runs whichever config is needed. I also found out that the sxhkdrc
will take precedence over other bindings and so have to figure out a
configuration that might utilise this. I also found people using
mappings to run different 'modes'  for sxhkd, which i might look into.
